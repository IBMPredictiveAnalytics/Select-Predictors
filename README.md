# Select-Predictors
This extension provides a user interface for the SELECTPR  ED command. It takes a specified set of predictor variables as input   and selects a smaller subset for use in predictive modeling procedure  s. A univariable method that considers each predictor in isolation is   used, as opposed to the multivariable method of selecting predictors   that is used by the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier extension. The Select Pre  dictors extension supports both categorical and scale dependent varia  bles. Large sets of predictors can be handled.
